# Theme Update Plan: "Midnight Pump" (Premium Dark UI)

As a Senior UI/UX Designer, I've evaluated the current interface. It's functional but lacks the "premium fitness app" polish. The current "gray-on-gray" is safe but generic. We will upgrade to a richer, more energetic aesthetic without sacrificing the clean dark mode utility.

## 1. Typography Upgrade (Brand Identity)
The current `Inter` is excellent for UI, but we need a "Display" font for headings to give the app a gym/fitness personality.
- [ ] **Action**: Import `Barlow Condensed` or `Oswald` (Google Fonts) in `index.css`.
- [ ] **Action**: Update `tailwind.config.js` to add `font-display`.
- [ ] **Action**: Apply `font-display` to `h1`, `h2`, and major stats in `HomeView` and `WorkoutView`.

## 2. Color Palette Refinement (Rich Dark)
Shift from neutral grays to a "cool gray" or "slate" base to add depth.
- [ ] **Action**: Update `tailwind.config.js` and `theme.js`.
    - Replace `gray-950` (Background) with a deep, rich color (e.g., `#09090b` or a very dark slate).
    - Tweak `emerald-500` to be slightly more vibrant or pair it with a secondary "Energy Orange" for intensity metrics.
    - Ensure `text-muted` has sufficient contrast (AA standard).

## 3. Visual Depth & Texture (Glassmorphism 2.0)
Flat backgrounds are boring. We want a subtle "tech/premium" feel.
- [ ] **Action**: Add a subtle background gradient or mesh blob in `index.css` (fixed position behind content) to give the app a "glow".
- [ ] **Action**: Update `Card.jsx`:
    - Add a subtle `bg-gradient-to-br` (e.g., from `gray-900` to `gray-800`).
    - Refine the border to be `white/5` instead of a solid gray color for a true glass feel.
    - Increase `backdrop-blur` slightly.

## 4. Component Polish
- [ ] **Action**: Update `Button.jsx`:
    - Primary: Add a subtle "inner glow" or stronger shadow to make it pop.
    - Secondary: Make it less "border-heavy" and more "surface-based".
- [ ] **Action**: Update `ProgressBar.jsx` (if exists) or stats cards to use gradients for the fill/text.

## 5. Micro-Interactions
- [ ] **Action**: Ensure all interactive elements (Cards, Buttons) have `active:scale-95` or similar tactile feedback.
- [ ] **Action**: Add `animate-in` classes to the main views for smooth entry (already partially present, but standardize it).

## 6. Data Visualization (Quick Wins)
- [ ] **Action**: In `HomeView`, replace simple text stats with visual indicators (e.g., a small progress ring for the streak or a bar chart for history). *Note: This might require new components.*

---
**Priority**: Start with Typography and Color Palette (1 & 2) as they have the highest visual impact with the lowest code churn.
